## 2. 当前实现范围

- The authoring workspace is the source of truth for `AGENTS.md`, workflow Skills, templates, policies, Makefile include assets and GitHub workflow assets.
- `package sync-source` copies or extracts those source files into `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**`.
- `package check-source` verifies that package assets have not drifted from authoring sources.
- User-project `sync` materializes package assets into the configured `<harnessRoot>` and project root using managed strategies.
- Authoring-only Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/authoring/**` are excluded from package assets.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml` | Source-to-asset manifest | `source_mappings`, `mode`, `exclude` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/commands/package-source.ts` | Package source command adapter | `package sync-source`, `package check-source` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/package-source.ts` | Source sync/check implementation | copy/extract/check modes, exclude handling |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/sync-engine.ts` | User-project materialization engine | managed strategies, marker handling |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/managed-file.ts` | Managed metadata blocks | `pjsdlc:sdlc-harness:*` markers |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**` | Package canonical assets | generated from authoring source by `package sync-source` |
| `.codex/skills/**` | Authoring source for workflow Skills | `pjsdlc_*`, `authoring/**` exclusion boundary |
| `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**` | Authoring source for templates, policies and Makefile include | `templates`, `policies`, `make` |
| `.github/workflows/harness.yml` | Authoring source for package CI asset | workflow asset mapping |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Regression tests for source sync and drift checks | source mapping, excludes, check-source |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Author edits Harness source files
-> sdlc-harness package sync-source
-> package assets are regenerated
-> sdlc-harness package check-source verifies no drift
-> npm package ships assets
-> user project runs sdlc-harness sync/upgrade
-> managed assets materialize into <harnessRoot> and root files
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `AGENTS.md` is synced as an extracted managed block, so project-specific text outside the block remains user-owned.
- Skills are distributed under `<harnessRoot>/skills`, while policies/templates live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- The package keeps a hard source mapping manifest, not a runtime scan of arbitrary repository paths.
- `copy-tree` supports exclude patterns so authoring-only material stays local to this repository.
- Makefile integration is an include block, allowing project-specific targets to win on name conflicts.
- The current package does not guarantee native skill hydration for every Agent. It distributes files in the chosen root and exposes Harness soft routing through `AGENTS.md`.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Legacy package layouts referenced `.harness/managed`, `.agents/skills` and `.agent/managed`; current generated assets use `<harnessRoot>/skills` and `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- DEV-043 removed the legacy implementation-doc directory as an active asset/documentation target; source sync does not treat `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/**` as a maintained path.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` | Regenerate package canonical assets from authoring source | PASS in source-sync and release tasks |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | Asset drift detection | PASS in source-sync, release and DEV-043 gates |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Mapping modes, excludes and drift errors | PASS in `npm test` |
| `make validate-harness` | Prompt language and generated overview consistency | PASS for DEV-043 |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-001`, `DEV-004` | Historical implementation commits | Introduced source mappings and package source sync/check commands. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-006` - `DEV-023` | Historical implementation commits | Migrated roots, markers and managed layout to the current package asset shape. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-037` - `DEV-039` | Historical implementation commits | Added authoring Skill boundary and excluded authoring assets from package sync. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Consolidated source-sync implementation facts from legacy task docs. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Any change to `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `AGENTS.md`, Makefile include or CI asset source should be followed by `package sync-source` and `package check-source`.
- If an operation becomes repetitive and deterministic, prefer extracting it into a script and documenting the script here instead of keeping it as manual release/development lore.
